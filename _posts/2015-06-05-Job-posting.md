## How to get a hold of us

You can email me at [jesse@sharedit.com](mailto:jesse@sharedit.com?Subject=I%20Work%20With%20You). You can attach a resume to the email if you would like. We will probably setup a time to go get a cup of coffee (or juice) downtown with a co-worker (Jay). We'll probably talk about what interests you and what your passionate about (it can be WoW or Canoe building if thats what your passionate about). Be truthful in what your looking for; if it's not us we might be able to help you connect with someone else.
